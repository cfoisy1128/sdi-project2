<p>I am writing about a recent trip I look to Key Largo with my family and our choice to go or not to go Parasailing.

There are three basic parts to my code. Will we go parasailing on vacation yes or no? Who will come on the boat with us? Family or just me and my daughter. The last element is will we choose the 600 or 1000 foot rope?</p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
